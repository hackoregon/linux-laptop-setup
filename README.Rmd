For those of you with Linux laptops, I'm building scripts to automate the setup process for those who want to work with native Linux tools. I've been using Linux workstations / laptops for 15 years, so I've pretty much seen everything that can break.

The scripts live in the repository <https://github.com/hackoregon/linux-laptop-setup>. They're modular; you only need to install packages if you're going to use them, although it won't hurt anything if you want to install them all.

1. Which Linux? As of this writing, 2016-10-26, it's looking like we'll be using 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS "Xenial Xerus" for Hack Oregon servers. So if you plan to get involved in the server side of development, I recommend using either one of the Ubuntu 16.04.1 64-bit desktops or 64-bit Linux Mint 18 "Sarah". I've switched my workstation and Linux laptop to Linux Mint 18, and that's where I developed the scripts.

    If you only have a 32-bit machine or want to run another Linux distro, don't worry. Just file an issue at https://github.com/hackoregon/linux-laptop-setup/issues/new and I'll port the scripts to it. I can make a virtual machine from almost any Linux install media out there, although you'll probably want to stick with the more popular ones.

2. Assuming you have a 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS or Linux Mint 18 install, download and unpack <https://github.com/hackoregon/linux-laptop-setup/archive/master.zip>. This will create a directory `linux-laptop-setup-master`.

3. Open a terminal and `cd` into the directory.

4. Type `./1core`. This will install a few core utilities, including `git` and `vim`. It will also install the Python utility `virtualenvwrapper`, which allows isolating Python applications in named virtual environments.

5. As I noted above, the scripts are modular - you only need to install what you're going to use. Roughly, by task:
    * Git Large File Storage: we used this last year for Crop Compass. Note that GitHub charges money for both storage and download bandwidth for this, so be careful! If you need it, type `./git-lfs`.
    * Data science: Install the `jupyter` package by typing `./jupyter`. This will create a Jupyter notebook Python 3 virtualenv. To run it, type
        ```
        workon jupyter
        jupyter notebook
        ```

        A browser will open with the Jupyter notebook web app. 

        Note that I've included the IPyParallel package (<http://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html>). If you've got a machine with multiple cores you'll be able to run larger problems with this.
    * Database / SQL: Install PostgreSQL by typing `./postgres`. This will install PostgreSQL and PgAdmin3 and create a PostgreSQL super-user with the same user ID as your Linux user ID. It will also create a database with that name. 

        Note that as installed, the PostgreSQL service is only accessible inside the workstation / laptop. If you need to expose it to a local area network, you'll need to do some configuration.
    * R platform: I don't know how much we'll be doing in R; Python 3 appears to be the language of choice for Hack Oregon data science work. But I'm a long-term R user and I've included a complete R environment including the latest RStudio preview release desktop and server. To install it, type `./R-platform`.

        This will take a long time to run. The biggest piece is the entire LaTeX toolchain - `texlive-full`. So if you're not using R, don't install this.
    * GIS: Type `./gis` to install the GIS packages. This script will execute `postgres` first. Then it will install PostGIS, Q(uantum)GIS and GRASS. There are also many Python and R GIS packages available; if you need one, open an issue and I'll add it to the scripts.
    * Vagrant: If you're making or using Vagrant boxes, install Vagrant with `./vagrant`.
    * VirtualBox: If you want to host virtual machines with VirtualBox, install it with `./virtualbox`. You will have a menu item added to start it.
    * Virtual Machine Manager: The "native" Linux virtual machine hosting software is called Virtual Machine Manager. To install it, type `./virt-manager`. You will have a menu item added to start it.
    * Docker hosting: If you want to run (or build) Docker images, install the Docker hosting with `./docker-hosting`. At the time of this writing it's not defined whether Hack Oregon will be using Docker. If we end up using it, I'll add more scripts to use the more advanced capabilities.

## Todo
1. Front-end tools: I'm not a front-end person so I have no idea what we'll need there. If there's something you want, file an issue and I'll add it.
2. Django: The last I heard we'll be using Django for some projects. I am working through <https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Django-Core-Complete-Guide-ebook/dp/B01KR6F4Z2> and can easily add install scripts if anyone wants them.
3. Anaconda: If we decide we're using it, I'll add an installer script, although it's easy to install from the web.
