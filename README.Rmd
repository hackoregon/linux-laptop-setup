## Design goals
1. Run at native speed on a machine that might be too small to host a Docker container, a Vagrant box or a full virtual machine guest.
2. Modular - you only install what you need to get your tasks done.
3. Use the same software versions that other Hack Oregon projects are using whenever possible.
4. The "server" subset must run in an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS system, including a Vagrant box.

## Which version of Linux should you use?
I've designed these scripts to function on Linux Mint 18 "Sarah" (<https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php>). They should work on any of the Linux Mint "Sarah" desktops, although I'm only testing them on the Cinnamon desktop at the moment. They should also work on any Ubuntu 16.04 LTS "Xenial Xerus" desktop. They will not work on more recent or older versions of Ubuntu.

If you have some other version of Linux already installed, open an issue at <https://github.com/hackoregon/linux-laptop-setup/issues/new>. It will only take me a half-day or thereabouts to port them to any recent Linux distro.

## Getting started
You'll need wall power and a reliable internet connection. Coffee shop WiFi can be problematic. I don't have an accurate RAM requirement defined yet but I know the `r-platform` script crashes if you don't have at least 1536 MiB in a 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 Vagrant box.

1. Download and unpack <https://github.com/hackoregon/linux-laptop-setup/archive/master.zip>. This will create a directory `linux-laptop-setup-master`.
2. Open a terminal and `cd` into the directory.
3. About `sudo`: `sudo` (super-user do) is a Linux utility that allows you to perform adminstrative tasks like installing software by temporarily operating as the `root` super-user. If you see the prompt `[sudo] password for <your username>: `, enter *your* password.
3. Type `./1core`. This will install a few core utilities, including `git` and `vim`. It will also install the Python utility `virtualenvwrapper`, which allows isolating Python applications in named virtual environments.
4. Log out and back in again. This sets the environment variables you need for the Python virtual environments.
5. The scripts are modular - you only need to install what you're going to use. By task:
    * Git Large File Storage: we used this last year for Crop Compass. Note that GitHub charges money for both storage and download bandwidth for this, so be careful! If you need it, type `./git-lfs`.
    * Data science: Install the `jupyter` package by typing `./jupyter`. This will create a Jupyter notebook Python 3 virtualenv. To run it, type
        ```
        workon jupyter
        jupyter notebook
        ```

        A browser will open with the Jupyter notebook web app. 

        Note that I've included the IPyParallel package (<http://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html>). If you've got a machine with multiple cores you'll be able to run larger problems with this.
    * Database / SQL / GIS: Install PostgreSQL, PostGIS and PgAdmin3 by typing `./postgres`. This will install PostgreSQL and PgAdmin3 and create a PostgreSQL super-user with the same user ID as your Linux user ID.

        Note that as installed, the PostgreSQL service is only accessible inside the workstation / laptop. If you need to expose it to a local area network, you'll need to do some configuration.
    * QGIS: Type `./qgis` to install the QGIS (Quantum GIS) package.
    * VirtualBox and Vagrant: Type `./virtualbox` to install VirtualBox. During the installation you'll be asked to accept the VirtualBox Extension Pack's Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL). 
    
        After you've installed VirtualBox, type `./vagrant` to install Vagrant.

## Advanced tools
1. The R platform: type `./r-platform` to install the R platform. This includes:

    * R
    * Java
    * The `tidyverse` data wrangling, modeling and visualization packages
    * The `Shiny` interactive application development package
    * The `flexdashboard`, `bookdown`, `tufte` and `rticles` authoring packages, and
    * The `devtools` and `roxygen2` package development tools.

2. RStudio: type `./rstudio-desktop` to install the RStudio Desktop. Type `./rstudio-server` to install the RStudio Server. You don't need both but it won't hurt anything if you have both of them.
3. Virtual Machine Manager: The "native" Linux virtual machine hosting software is called Virtual Machine Manager. To install it, type `./virt-manager`. You will have a menu item added to start it.
4. Docker hosting: If you want to run (or build) Docker images, install the Docker hosting with `./docker-hosting`.

## Todo
1. Instructions for connecting QGIS to the PostGIS database.
1. Front-end tools: I'm not a front-end person so I have no idea what we'll need there. If there's something you want, file an issue and I'll add it.
2. Django: The last I heard we'll be using Django for some projects. I am working through <https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Django-Core-Complete-Guide-ebook/dp/B01KR6F4Z2> and can easily add install scripts if anyone wants them.
3. Anaconda: If we decide we're using it, I'll add an installer script, although it's easy to install from the web.
